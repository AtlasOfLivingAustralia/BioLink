##BioLink
BioLink is an integrated software package for the collection, maintenance, analysis, application and dissemination of taxonomic, biodiversity and environmental information. It was originally developed during 1998-1999 by CSIRO (Entomology), and has undergone a number minor revisions since then, with the last legacy release being version 2.5.

This redevelopment is being funded by the Atlas of Living Australia. The Atlas of Living Australia is an initiative to improve access to essential information on Australiaâ€™s biodiversity by providing tools for researchers and others to access, combine and map data on Australian species. The Atlas project is a partnership between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), the Australian natural history collections community and the Australian Government. For more information, go to http://www.ala.org.au.

The goals of the version 3.0 development effort are:
- modernize the legacy code base to in order to facilitate future enhancements and modifications
- make available the source code under an open source license
- address any outstanding issues with the legacy application
