# Introduction #

BioLink is an integrated software package for the collection, maintenance, analysis, application and dissemination of taxonomic, biodiversity and environmental information. It was originally developed during 1998-1999 by CSIRO (Entomology), and has undergone a number minor revisions since then, with the current release being version 2.5.

The original version of BioLink was written in Visual Basic 6/C++ and sits on top a Microsoft SQL Server database. This project aims to replace the user interface portion of BioLink with a Microsoft WPF application using .NET4/C#. It is envisaged that the BioLink database structure will remain untouched, thus allowing an easy upgrade for existing BioLink users.

Version 3 of BioLink makes use of several third party libraries, details of which can be found [here](ThirdPartySoftware.md).
